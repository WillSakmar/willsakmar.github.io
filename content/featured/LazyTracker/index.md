The Lazy Portfolio Tracker is a lightweight Python-based dashboard that simulates and monitors a simple, diversified investment portfolio—like a 60/40 split between stocks and bonds (e.g., VTI/BND). It fetches historical price data using the yfinance API, calculates the portfolio’s performance over time, and visualizes both its value growth and current asset allocation. The tool also includes logic for periodic rebalancing to maintain target weights and allows users to export performance data to CSV for further analysis.
