Hello! I'm William Sakmar — a U.S.-Swedish dual citizen with roots in New York City, shaped by a globally mobile upbringing and a deep curiosity about financial markets and political economy.

I’m currently completing my bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and Political Science at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/stockholm-business-school/), with a concentration in Finance. Along the way, I’ve embraced every challenge — from adapting to new cultures in Stockholm and Montpellier, to juggling high-pressure roles at [Muzinich & Co.](https://www.muzinich.com), the [American Chamber of Commerce](https://www.amcham.se), and one of Sweden’s largest student-run career fairs, all while studying full-time.

This experience has strengthened my resilience, time management, and what I like to call “social elasticity” — the ability to navigate unfamiliar environments with adaptability and grace. It also affirmed my passion for credit markets and my ambition to pursue a career in investment management in New York.

Beyond finance, I’m a lifelong learner, a CFA Level 1 candidate, and an aspiring reader of Robert Caro’s The Power Broker (yes, still working on it!). I enjoy golf, swimming, good food, and reading.
